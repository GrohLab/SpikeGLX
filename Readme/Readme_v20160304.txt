Version
-------
SpikeGLX Release v20160304.


Changes Since 20160302
-----------------------
+ Imec support at v3.4 (faster startup, improved reference signal routing).
+ Fix run startup bug.
+ Fix DC subtraction bug.
+ Fix NI digital channel issue.
+ Message if set bank out of range.
+ Right-click to edit Imec settings.


Changes Since 20160301
-----------------------
+ v20160101 removed from site.
+ Fix bug setting bank 0.
+ Include SpikeGLX-MATLAB-SDK in release.
+ Updated help text/UserManual with discussion of performance topics.


Changes Since 20160101
-----------------------
+ SpikeGLX folder requires "libNeuropix_basestation_api.dll".
+ Configuration dialog gets {Devices, IM Setup} Tabs.
+ Updated run pause/resume options moved from Triggers Tab to Gates Tab.
+ Data are processed in two parallel "streams": imec stream, nidq stream.
+ Each stream generates own datafiles {.imec.bin, .imec.meta} {.nidq.bin, .nidq.meta}.
+ Some renaming of metadata items to distinguish stream type.
+ Each stream gets own channel map and own save-channel string.
+ Each stream gets own GraphsWindow viewer pane.
+ All graphing uses pages of stacked traces.
+ New GraphsWindow Run Toolbar layout.
+ NI viewer gets low-pass filter option.
+ Matlab API modified to fetch from either imec or nidq stream.
+ Online help text rewritten.
+ Includes SpikeGLX.exe:       Real Imec and NI-DAQ acquisition.
+ Includes SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe: Real Imec and simulated NI_DAQ acquisition.


Temporarily disabled:
- Spike trigger option.
- TTL trigger option.
- AO for Imec channels.
- Offline file viewer for Imec files.
- GraphsWindow save-channel checkboxes.


Changes Since 20151231
-----------------------
- Fix bug: SpikeGLX hangs on remote setTrgEnable command.
- Fix bug: Remote setRunName doesn't handle _g_t tags correctly.
- Data files now get double extension '.nidq.bin', '.nidq.meta'.
- Offline file viewer enabled.


Before Starting
---------------
You are urged to read the included 'UserManual.html' to familiarize yourself with some important concepts.


Deployment
----------
- If you are running the NI-DAQ enabled version (SpikeGLX.exe): National Instruments 'NI-DAQ' software must already be installed. This is likely true if you are already running an older version of SpikeGLX or LabView on the target PC.
- If you are running the simulated NI-DAQ version (SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe): NI-DAQ software is not needed. This version generates a simple 1Hz sine wave on all analog channels in the nidq stream if you enable NI acquisition on the Configuration dialog Devices Tab.

Copy the 'SpikeGLX' folder to the C: drive.

PLEASE DELETE ANY EXISTING SpikeGLX/configs FOLDER.
