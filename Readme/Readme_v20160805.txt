Version
-------
SpikeGLX Release v20160805.

Imec firmware at v4.2 (included); Imec API at v4.3.

If you have a broken EEPROM chip email <karshb@janelia.hhmi.org>
to get a Dropbox link to probe calibration data.

There are two major additions to this release:

1) All online and offline stream viewers get DC-offset subtraction
which is now termed time averaging "-<T>" and they get spatial averaging
"-<S>." Spatial averaging uses the new ShankMap construct describing
how electrodes are physically arranged on the probe. Further discussion
is available in the help.

2) Imec has determined that the oscillations that ensue when using internal
referencing on option-3 probes are mitigated by turning off approximately
10% of the readout channels. To allow you to experiment with this, the
IM Setup tab of the configuration dialog lets you name any list of channels
to turn off (off-channels are still read from the probe, graphed, saved).
Moreover, we now disconnect any reference channels which are not referenced
by other channels, so remaining on-channels should suffer less attenuation
and show better common-mode subtraction behavior. Our own observation is that
if too few channels are turned off the oscillations may initially be absent
but appear after some minutes of running. You can now try this yourself.

Temporarily disabled:

Original 20151231
-----------------
- Function set very close to original SpikeGL.


Before Starting
---------------
You are urged to read the included 'UserManual.html' to familiarize yourself with some important concepts.


Deployment
----------
- If you are running the NI-DAQ enabled version (SpikeGLX.exe): National Instruments 'NI-DAQ' software must already be installed. This is likely true if you are already running an older version of SpikeGLX or LabView on the target PC.
- If you are running the simulated NI-DAQ version (SpikeGLX_NISIM.exe): NI-DAQ software is not needed. This version generates a simple 1Hz sine wave on all analog channels in the nidq stream if you enable NI acquisition on the Configuration dialog Devices Tab.

Copy the 'SpikeGLX' folder to the C: drive.

***
PLEASE DELETE ANY EXISTING SpikeGLX/configs FOLDER.
START WITH VIRGIN SETTINGS AS MANY HAVE CHANGED.

Double-click the SPikeGLX.exe icon.
